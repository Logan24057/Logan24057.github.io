            <p>
                Hi, my name is Logan Danner and I am a senior in the Computer Programming and Interactive Media
                Technical Area at York County School of Technology. I value a positive and friendly work environment. I
                also have my CompTIA ITF+ certification and I am currently working towards another certification.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently working on a classroom project called Onlypogs. It is a digital library of pogs for the
                students to look at and use. Pogs are a token-like form of classroom currency that is used to motivate
                students to work harder and better. Students are also awarded pogs for doing extra work and
                participating in school events or clubs, as well as taking opportunities outside of school to further
                their careers.
